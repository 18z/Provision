Provisioning Debian
=========

These are setups that I feel comfortable to work with.

To provision working environment with these setups

1. Install Git

        $ apt-get update
        $ apt-get install git
        
2. Clone settings from github

        $ git clone https://github.com/deanboole/provision
        
3. Start provisioning

        $ sh provision/scripts/provision.sh
