Provisioning Work Env.
=========

These are settings that I feel comfortable to work with.

To provision working environment with these settings:

1. Install Git, curl and tmux

    ```
    You know how to do it. :D
    ```

2. VIM Configurations

    ```bash
    $ curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanboole/Provision/master/scripts/vim-install.sh | sh
    ```

3. Bash environment Configurations

    ```bash
    $ curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanboole/Provision/master/scripts/bashrc-install.sh | sh
    ```

4. Git Configurations

    ```bash
    $ curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanboole/Provision/master/scripts/git-install.sh | sh
    ```

5. Tmux Configurations

    ```bash
    $ curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanboole/Provision/master/scripts/tmux-install.sh | sh
    ```
